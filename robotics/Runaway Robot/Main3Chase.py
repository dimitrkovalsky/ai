# ----------
# Part Three
#
# Now you'll actually track down and recover the runaway Traxbot. 
# In this step, your speed will be about twice as fast the runaway bot,
# which means that your bot's distance parameter will be about twice that
# of the runaway. You can move less than this parameter if you'd 
# like to slow down your bot near the end of the chase. 
#
# ----------
# YOUR JOB
#
# Complete the next_move function. This function will give you access to 
# the position and heading of your bot (the hunter); the most recent 
# measurement received from the runaway bot (the target), the max distance
# your bot can move in a given timestep, and another variable, called 
# OTHER, which you can use to keep track of information.
# 
# Your function will return the amount you want your bot to turn, the 
# distance you want your bot to move, and the OTHER variable, with any
# information you want to keep track of.
# 
# ----------
# GRADING
# 
# We will make repeated calls to your next_move function. After
# each call, we will move the hunter bot according to your instructions
# and compare its position to the target bot's true position
# As soon as the hunter is within 0.01 stepsizes of the target,
# you will be marked correct and we will tell you how many steps it took
# before your function successfully located the target bot. 
#
# As an added challenge, try to get to the target bot as quickly as 
# possible.
